  About the project
</h2>

<p dir="auto">
  Shanes Cards current website can be found here: <a href="https://www.shanescards.net/">Shanes Cards</a>, and is a local game store that specializes in board games, card games, and miniature figurines. The website in its current form has little function, and lacks          features that could improve Shanes Cards online presence such as: giving customers the ability to pre-order new card sets, send in single card requests, or build complete decks that are then built in-store for pickup.
</p>
<p>
    The redesign of the original website will include all of those features, as well as an overhaul of the layout to be more user-friendly and interactable. As this project is being built, I will be showing the owner of the card store my changes, getting his feedback on       on any features or design choices, and making further changes according to the vision he has for the website.
